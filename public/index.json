Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by retrieving and incorporating external knowledge into input prompts. In particular, due to LLMs' context window limitations and long-context hallucinations, only the most relevant \"chunks\" are retrieved. However, current RAG systems face three key challenges: (1) chunks are often retrieved independently without considering their relationships, such as redundancy and orders; (2) the utility of chunks is non-monotonic, as adding more chunks can degrade quality; and (3) retrieval strategies fail to adapt to the unique characteristics of different queries. To overcome these challenges, we design a cost-constrained retrieval optimization framework for RAG. We adopt a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based strategy to find the optimal chunk combination order, which considers the chunks' correlations. In addition, to address the non-monotonicity of chunk utility, instead of treating budget exhaustion as the termination condition, we design a utility computation strategy to identify the optimal chunk combination without necessarily exhausting the budget. Furthermore, we propose a configuration agent that predicts optimal configurations for each query domain, improving our framework's adaptability and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 30% improvement over baseline models, highlighting the framework's effectiveness, scalability, and suitability.","tags":null,"title":"CARROT: A Learned Cost-Constrained Retrieval Optimization System for RAG","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingyi Yang","Jiachen Shi","Jian Chen","Gao Cong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1777939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1777939200,"objectID":"01195978b9f456e9ee09aa1d5ff6184b","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/publication/icde26-solar/","publishdate":"2026-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icde26-solar/","section":"publication","summary":"The burgeoning volumes of spatial data from location-based applications and GPS-enabled devices present unique challenges in spatial database design, necessitating both efficient data ingestion and query processing mechanisms. Existing Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM-tree) based spatial databases, while adept at handling high-speed data ingestion, are less efficient for spatial queries as they adopt a general-purpose storage model and only support spatial queries as an afterthought. We introduce SOLAR, a novel LSM-based spatial data store tailored to achieve both rapid ingestion and fast spatial query processing. SOLAR treats spatial data as first-class citizens in its spatial-centric storage model, clustering the data by the spatial attributes in a single-LSM design. To enable efficient query processing on the new storage model, we design query processing algorithms that effectively prune away irrelavant LSM component files for both spatial range queries and KNN queries. Recognizing the challenge of increased write amplification due to the spatial-partitioned data layout, SOLAR implements a novel selective compaction framework, where compactions only involve a selected set of component files. This is supported by a cost model-based selection policy, optimizing query performance while ensuring low write amplification. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SOLAR over existing LSM-based spatial systems and PostgreSQL across different dynamic workload scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"SOLAR: Efficient Spatial Queries on LSM-based Storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"TATA: An Efficient Framework for Task Transfer in Query Plan Representation.

To address these challenges, we present FDABench, a benchmark for evaluating data agents' reasoning ability over heterogeneous data in analytical scenarios. Our contributions are threefold: (1) A comprehensive benchmark of 2,007 tasks spanning six data modalities with a unified, multi-granularity evaluation framework. (2) We design PUDDING, an agentic dataset construction framework that leverages LLM generation with iterative expert validation for reliable and scalable benchmark construction.

However, existing studies typically focus on one task, and propose a novel design to represent query plans along with a ML4DB framework, without comparing with other representation methods designed for a different task. This raises a critical question: How do we select a query plan representation method in a ML4DB system?\nTo address this question, we perform a comparative study on ten representation methods on three distinct ML4DB tasks: cost estimation, index selection and query optimization. Our extensive experiments not only verify the interchangeability of representation methods across different tasks, but also identify consistently high-performing models. Further, we dissect the query plan representation into two core components: feature encoding and tree model, and evaluate the impact of design choices for each in different scenarios. Our results show that the findings for tasks optimizing absolute errors are different from findings for tasks optimizing relative errors. Some findings challenge widely-held assumptions, i.e., one finding shows that tree models do not significantly impact cost estimation results, but only play a significant role to optimize relative performance. Practical guidelines and future directions are provided based on the findings of the study.\n","date":1714521600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714521600,"objectID":"825304e547802ad69a6a989f37dca889","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/24-05-01-vldb-24-evaluation/","publishdate":"2024-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/24-05-01-vldb-24-evaluation/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Zhao Yue and Li Zhaodonghui for publishing the paper “A Comparative Study and Component Analysis of Query Plan Representation Techniques in ML4DB Studies” at VLDB 2024.\n","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation Paper on Query Plan Representation accepted at VLDB 2024","type":"post"},{"authors":["Gao Cong","Jingyi Yang","Yue Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, existing R-tree packing methods rely on a set of fixed heuristic rules, which may not be suitable for different data distributions and workload patterns. To address the limitations of existing R-tree packing methods, we propose PLATON, a top-down R-tree packing method with learned partition policy that explicitly optimizes the query performance with regard to the given data and workload instance. We develop a learned partition policy based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and carefully make design choices for the MCTS exploration strategy and simulation strategy to improve algorithm convergence. We propose a divide and conquer strategy and two optimization techniques, early termination and level-wise sampling, to drastically reduce the MCTS algorithm’s time complexity and make it a linear-time algorithm.

However, if multiple users submit queries within a short time frame, it can result in potential issues such as redundant computation and query concurrency. Unfortunately, most existing multi-query optimization methods, which aim to enhance query processing efficiency, have not adequately addressed these two problems, especially in the setting where multiple queries are being executed concurrently. To this end, we propose a novel method named Lemo for the multi-query optimization problem. Specifically, we propose a novel value network to predict latencies of concurrent queries as the foundation model for query plan generation. Furthermore, we introduce a shared buffer manager component to cache the intermediate results of sub-queries. The shared buffer manager applies a novel replacement policy to maintain the cached buffer with the objective of maximizing the opportunity for the reuse of the cached sub-queries. Based on the shared buffer, our proposed value network can incorporate the cached results into cost estimation to further guide Lemo in generating query plans, thus avoiding redundant computation.

Despite being a well-researched area for decades, most existing estimators are designed to handle comparison predicates over numeric and categorical data. Nevertheless, Set-valued data are ubiquitous in many applications such as information retrieval and recommendation systems. However, these estimators may not be effective for handling predicates over set-valued data. In this work, we presents novel techniques for selectivity estimation on queries involving predicates over set-valued attributes. We first propose the set-valued column factorization problem, whereby each each set-valued column is converted to multiple numeric subcolumns, and set containment predicates are converted to numeric comparison predicates. This enables us to leverage any existing estimator to perform selectivity estimation. We then develop two methods for column factorization and query conversion, namely ST and ST-hist. We integrate ST and ST-hist into three estimators, Postgres, Neurocard, and DeepDB. We then conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis by comparing our approach against three baselines across three different datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods exhibit superior estimation accuracy while maintaining high efficiency compared to the baseline techniques.\n","date":1693008e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693008e3,"objectID":"0b7344688df1fa5bf189d2ec807a9a22","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/23-08-26-sigmod-24-set/","publishdate":"2023-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-08-26-sigmod-24-set/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Zizhong for publishing the paper “Selectivity Estimation for Queries Containing Predicates over Set-Valued Attributes” at SIGMOD 2024.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on selectivity estimation for set-valued data accepted at SIGMOD 2024","type":"post"},{"authors":["Jingyi Yang","Gao Cong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

To find an optimum index configuration for a workload, accurately and efficiently quantifying the benefits of each candidate index configuration is indispensable. As materializing each index configuration candidate and physically executing queries are infeasible, most of index tuners rely on the cost estimations from optimizer with “what-if” API. However, “what-if” based index benefit estimations have the following two limitations. Firstly, they generate significant errors, which compromise index recommendation quality. Secondly, generating query plans and benefit estimations for each candidate index configuration takes a considerable amount of time. To address the two challenges in index selection, we propose an effective end-to-end machine learning based index benefit estimator. In particular, we propose novel feature extraction and encoding techniques that do not rely on “what-if” call to generate query plan for each index configuration candidate. In addition, we design an attention mechanism to address index interaction issue and aggregate the impacts of different query operations. Finally, we leverage transfer learning technique to improve the estimator’s learning ability for adaption to new database.

It becomes a challenge for cloud providers to benchmark different DBMS for a specific database instance without having access to the underlying data. One viable solution is to leverage a query workload, which contains a set of queries and the corresponding cardinalities, to generate a synthetic database with similar query performance. Existing methods for database generation with cardinality constraints, however, can only handle very small query workloads due to their high complexity and encounter challenges when handling join queries. In this work, we propose SAM, a supervised deep autoregressive model-based method for database generation from query workloads. First, SAM is able to process large-scale query workloads efficiently as its complexity is linear in the size of the query workload, the number of attributes and the attribute domain size. Second, we develop algorithms to obtain unbiased samples of base relations from the deep autoregressive model and assign join keys in a way that accurately recovers the full outer join of the target database. Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SAM is able to efficiently generate a high-fidelity database that not only satisfies the input cardinality constraints, but also is close to the target database.\n","date":1646784e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1646784e3,"objectID":"933983f9b8671d447fb59e43fa7576b9","permalink":"https://MLxDB.github.io/post/22-03-09-sigmod-22/","publishdate":"2022-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/22-03-09-sigmod-22/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Yang Jingyi and Wu Peizhi for publishing the paper “SAM: Database Generation from Query Workloads with Supervised Autoregressive Models” at SIGMOD 2022.\n","tags":null,"title":"Paper on database generation accepted at SIGMOD 2022","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Zhao Yue and Shi Jiachen for publishing the paper “QueryFormer: A Tree Transformer Model for Query Plan Representation” at VLDB 2022.\nMachine learning has become a prominent method in many database optimization problems such as cost estimation, index selection and query optimization.
