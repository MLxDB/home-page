Congratulations to Gu Tu for publishing the paper "Effectively Learning Spatial Indexes with a Support for Updates" at SIGMOD 2023.
<!--more-->

Learned indices have been proposed to replace classic index structures
like B-Tree with machine learning (ML) models. They require
to replace both the indices and query processing algorithms currently
deployed by the databases, and such a radical departure is
likely to encounter challenges and obstacles. In contrast, we propose
a fundamentally different way of using ML techniques to build
a better R-Tree without the need to change the structure or query
processing algorithms of traditional R-Tree. Specifically, we develop
reinforcement learning (RL) based models to decide how to choose
a subtree for insertion and how to split a node when building and
updating an R-Tree, instead of relying on hand-crafted heuristic
rules currently used by the R-Tree and its variants. Experiments on
real and synthetic datasets with up to more than 100 million spatial
objects show that our RL based index outperforms the R-Tree and
its variants in terms of query processing time.
