We are the **Data+AI Group** at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). Our research focuses on **Data management and AI**, bridging the gap between data management and artificial intelligence. We explore two main directions: **DB4AI** (Database for AI) and **AI4DB** (AI for Database). Our research includes learned index, learned query optimization and data generation. Our projects are supported by grants awarded by Ministry of Education, NRF, IAF, Singtel/NCS, Roll-Royce, Alibaba, and Microsoft.
